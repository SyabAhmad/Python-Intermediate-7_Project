# ```#1 URL Shortener```
A command-line tool that shortens URLs to make them more manageable and easy to share. Users can input a long URL, and the program generates a short URL that redirects to the original URL.

## ```pyshorteners```
is a Python library that provides a simple and easy-to-use interface to various URL shortening services. It allows you to shorten URLs using popular services such as bit.ly, tinyurl.com, and many others.

To install ```pyshorteners```, you can use pip, the package manager for Python. Simply run the following command in your terminal:

## ```pip install pyshorteners```

Once installed, you can use pyshorteners in your Python code to shorten URLs. Here's an example:

```python runable
import pyshorteners

s = pyshorteners.Shortener()
short_url = s.tinyurl.short('https://www.example.com/some/long/url')
print(short_url)
```
This code creates a Shortener object and then uses the tinyurl service to shorten the URL https://www.example.com/some/long/url. The shortened URL is then printed to the console.

pyshorteners supports many other services as well, including bit.ly, is.gd, and t.co, among others.

You can use these services by simply replacing tinyurl with the service of your choice, like this:

```short_url = s.bitly.short('https://www.example.com/some/long/url')```

In addition to shortening URLs, pyshorteners also supports expanding shortened URLs, as well as other URL-related functionality such as checking if a URL is valid and extracting the domain name from a URL.

Overall, pyshorteners is a useful Python library for working with URLs and can save you time and effort when dealing with long URLs in your code.
